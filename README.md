#   Hi there 👋
I'm Anudeep — a product innovation officer at [kiwinash](https://kiwinash.com). Previously worked on the Community & Safety team to help communities grow welcoming and productive spaces. I live in Hyderabad, IN and am an East Coast native. 🙌 I'm a huge nerd/geek, frequently validate my internet-product ideas, and aspiring entreprenuer. 💕

## My values

🌟 Expression as authentic self<br>
🍏 Beginner's mindset and curiosity<br>
🙌 Shared norms<br>
🚀 Elevate the underrepresented

## How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. 😸
